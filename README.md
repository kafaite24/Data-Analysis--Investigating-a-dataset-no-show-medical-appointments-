# Data-Analysis--Investigating-a-dataset-no-show-medical-appointments-

## Overview

In this project, we will be analysing a dataset of appoinment records for Brasil public hospitals. It is associated with how many patients show up to the doctors after making an appointment. In particular, we will be finding trends among patients who show up timely on appointments and how they differ from those who do not show up. 
Using descriptive statistics the following questions should be answered: 

1- What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment? 

2- Whether the waiting time (difference between the day appointment was scheduled and when it actually was) impacted the chances of people showing up?

**Note:** Predictive analytics is out of scope of this project.

For details see the attached Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) or HTML file.
